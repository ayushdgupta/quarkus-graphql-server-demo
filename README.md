1-> Here we implemented one Server which can respond to the GraphQL API's and the corresponding
normal REST Endpoints as well.

2-> Here we also learned the concept of @OneToMany UniDirectional mapping as well.

3-> We have also done some Hit and trial on the query string for how to fetch the data
within @OneToMany annotation or how to apply any filter in the class reference with
@OneToMany annotation.
